‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home/

  "name": "Smartphone Pro",
  "image": "assets/images/products/electronics/smartphone-pro.webp",
  "imageAlt": "Black smartphone with premium design and advanced camera system"
}
```

### Step 4: Add Multiple Images Per Product

Enhance your products with multiple angles:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Smartphone Pro",
  "images": [
    {
      "url": "assets/images/products/electronics/smartphone-pro-front.webp",
      "alt": "Smartphone front view",
      "isPrimary": true
    },
    {
      "url": "assets/images/products/electronics/smartphone-pro-back.webp",
      "alt": "Smartphone back view",
      "isPrimary": false
    },
    {
      "url": "assets/images/products/electronics/smartphone-pro-side.webp",
      "alt": "Smartphone side view",
      "isPrimary": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## üé® Image Style Guidelines

### Consistency Standards

- [ ] Sharp focus on the product
- [ ] Consistent lighting across all images
- [ ] Clean, distraction-free background

## üöÄ Advanced Image Features

### Lazy Loading Implementation

Add to your JavaScript:

```javascript
// Lazy loading for better performance
function implementLazyLoading() {
  const images = document.querySelectorAll("img[data-src]");
  const imageObserver = new IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => {
    entries.forEach((entry) => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        const img = entry.target;
        img.src = img.dataset.src;
        img.classList.remove("lazy");
        imageObserver.unobserve(img);
      }
    });
  });

  images.forEach((img) => imageObserver.observe(img));
}
```

### Image Zoom Feature

Add zoom functionality to product detail pages:

```css
.product-image-zoom {
  overflow: hidden;
  cursor: zoom-in;
}

.product-image-zoom img {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.product-image-zoom:hover img {
  transform: scale(1.5);
}
```

### Responsive Images

Use responsive images for different screen sizes:

```html
<picture>
  <source
    media="(max-width: 480px)"
    srcset="assets/images/products/smartphone-mobile.webp"
  />
  <source
    media="(max-width: 768px)"
    srcset="assets/images/products/smartphone-tablet.webp"
  />
  <img
    src="assets/images/products/smartphone-desktop.webp"
    alt="Smartphone Pro"
  />
</picture>
```

## üìä Image Performance Tips

### File Size Optimization

- **Target**: Under 200KB per image
- **WebP**: 25-35% smaller than JPEG
- **Progressive JPEG**: Loads gradually
- **SVG**: Perfect for icons and simple graphics

### Loading Strategies

1. **Critical images**: Load immediately (above-the-fold)
2. **Secondary images**: Lazy load
3. **Thumbnails**: Use smaller versions
4. **Fallbacks**: Always have a backup plan

### SEO Benefits

- Use descriptive file names: `red-running-shoes-nike.webp`
- Include alt text for accessibility
- Add structured data for rich snippets
- Consider image sitemaps for large catalogs

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Implementation

### Replace Current SVG Placeholders

1. Download images from recommended sources
2. Optimize using TinyPNG or similar
3. Place in `assets/images/products/`
4. Update `products.json` with new paths
5. Test in browser

### Example: Complete Product Entry

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Smartphone Pro",
  "description": "Latest smartphone with advanced features...",
  "price": 699.99,
  "image": "assets/images/products/electronics/smartphone-pro.webp",
