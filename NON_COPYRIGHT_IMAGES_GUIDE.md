## 🛠️ How to Replace Images

### Method 1: Using Image URLs (Easy)

1. **Find an image** on Unsplash/Pexels
2. **Copy the image URL** (right-click → Copy image address)
3. **Replace the data URI** in `products.json`:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Smartphone Pro",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511707171634-5f897ff02aa9"
}
```

### Method 2: Download and Host Locally (Recommended)

1. **Download the image** from the stock photo site
2. **Optimize the image**:
   - Resize to 400x400px for thumbnails
   - Save as JPG (for photos) or PNG (for graphics)
   - Compress to keep file size under 100KB
3. **Save to your project**:
   ```
   ecommerce-app/
   └── assets/
       └── images/
           └── products/
               ├── smartphone-real.jpg
               ├── headphones-real.jpg
               └── laptop-real.jpg
   ```
4. **Update products.json**:
   ```json
   {
     "id": 1,
     "name": "Smartphone Pro",
     "image": "assets/images/products/smartphone-real.jpg"
   }
   ```

### Method 3: Create Your Own Product Images

**For Physical Products:**

- Use a **white backdrop**
- Ensure **even lighting** (natural light works best)
- Take photos from **multiple angles**
- Use a **tripod** for stability
- Edit for **consistent sizing** and **color correction**

**For Digital Products/Services:**

- Create **mockups** using free tools like Canva
- Use **icon libraries** like Font Awesome or Heroicons
- Design **simple graphics** with tools like GIMP (free)

## 🎨 Image Optimization Tips

### 1. Consistent Sizing

```css
.product-image {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  object-fit: cover;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```

### 2. Responsive Images

```html
<img
  src="assets/images/products/smartphone.jpg"
  srcset="
    assets/images/products/smartphone-400.jpg 400w,
